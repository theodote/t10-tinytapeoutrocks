## How it works

The project spells out "tinytapeoutrocks" letter by letter with every clock cycle. It is best run at 2 Hz or manually.
The eight outputs must be mapped to the seven segment display's segments in the "classic" manner, same as in Wokwi (from top, clockwise, middle, decimal).

## How to test

Operate the design in manual clock mode. Press the clock button. On every press, the letter displayed should change to the next one. The full cycle is 16 symbols long.

## External hardware

No external hardware is needed as long as the outputs are mapped to the correct segments.
